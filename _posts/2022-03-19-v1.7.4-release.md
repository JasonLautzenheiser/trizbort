Small update that fixed a couple of important fixes that unfortunately were introduced during the last release.

### Fixes

- Mini-map was broken and didn't display ([#548](https://github.com/JasonLautzenheiser/trizbort/issues/548))
- Menu item checkboxes were visually too small and messing up the look of the menus. ([#549](https://github.com/JasonLautzenheiser/trizbort/issues/549))
- When exporting to I7 and using regions, rooms are ignored if region is named a reserved word. ([#506](https://github.com/JasonLautzenheiser/trizbort/issues/506))
