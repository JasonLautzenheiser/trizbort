Trizbort is a simple tool used to create maps for interactive fiction. First developed by [genstein](http://trizbort.genstein.net/) back in 2010, he continued to update until March, 2013 when he open-sourced the code. Fast forward to 2015 when I picked up the development and along with [Andrew Schultz](https://github.com/andrewschultz) (focused on documentation and testing) we continue to improve this great software.
