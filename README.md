# Trizbort 

Trizbort is a simple tool used to create maps for interactive fiction. First developed by genstein back in 2010, he continued to update until March, 2013 when he open-sourced the code and uploaded it here to Github. Fast forward to 2015 when I picked up the development and along with Andrew Schultz (focused on documentation and testing) we continue to improve this great software.
