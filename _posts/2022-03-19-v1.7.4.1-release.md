Thanks to a few users that reported some UI issues when Trizbort was run at a different scale mode (for example, setting windows to scale to 125%).  You can see one such issue in [issue 556](https://github.com/JasonLautzenheiser/trizbort/issues/556).   During my tests, things look good now, but I have missed something at some scale or some other situation.  Please be on the lookout for any anomolies and [create an issue](https://github.com/JasonLautzenheiser/trizbort/issues/new) or start a [new discussion](https://github.com/JasonLautzenheiser/trizbort/discussions)

Pick up the latest version [here](https://github.com/JasonLautzenheiser/trizbort/releases/tag/v1.7.4.1).
